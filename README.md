Assuming, You have _Node_ and _npm_ properly installed on your machine, you need to:

1. Download/clone the project (**Tip**: If you want to create a new directory and navigate inside that folder, so you can open with your editor, you can do `take project_name`, instead of `mkdir project_name` and then `cd project_name`.)

2. Navigate to inside the project folder on terminal, where you would hopefully see a _package.json_ file. :)

3. Execute `npm i` for installing all the project dependencies.

4. Then `npm start`, `npm run dev` or `node server`. :)

7. Now, it should be as easy as typing *localhost:3000* into your favourite web browser. ;)
